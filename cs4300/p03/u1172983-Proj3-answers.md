## Kevin Song (u1211977) and Qianlang Chen (u1172983)

### Written Answers

### Qianlang Chen's Answers:

1. What was the hardest part of the assignment for you?

- Definitely getting the project started--we spent 4 hours on _Question 1,_ and only about 4 more hours on the rest.

2. What was the easiest part of the assignment for you?

- _Question 2_ and _Question 4._ _Question 5_ was also comparatively easy since the pseudo-code was already given.

3. What problem(s) helped further your understanding of the course material?

- All of them. The project is the only place we get to put theory into practice in this class, and I wouldn't trade such an opportunity for anything.

4. Did you feel any problems were tedious and not helpful to your understanding of the material?

- No.

5. What other feedback do you have about this homework?

- More instructions, but honestly, I realize that there's never a time we have "enough instructions." Maybe more documentation of functions in _Question 1_ since that's where we're getting started and not yet used to any of the existing code structures. It'd also help very to include more documentation on the arguments and return values, especially for questions toward the beginning of the project. Same could be applied to all the projects we've done so far.

3.2 Self Analysis (5 pts)

### Kevin Song's Answers:

1. What was the hardest part of the assignment for you?

The hardest part was the 3.1.1 Value Iteration. Specifically, I had a really hard time trying to figure out what the value iteration really is. And we need to figure out a way to encapsulate the algorithm into the different methods that have been provided.

2. What was the easiest part of the assignment for you?

The easiest part was the 3.1.2 and 3.1.8. These analysis questions are easy to complete once we understand what noise, discount factor and learning rate do to the overall policy.

3. What problem(s) helped further your understanding of the course material?

All of the problems helped further my understanding of the course because we have to implement the algorithm ourselves. And we have to understand the algorithm to effectively implement them.

4. Did you feel any problems were tedious and not helpful to your understanding of the material?

No, all of the problems are fun and challenging, and they are extremely effective on helping me understand the material.

5. What other feedback do you have about this homework?

I think we should have better instructions, especially the first problem. Maybe putting more documentations and comments on the methods of the first problem: the type of the parameters, what they do and so on. But overall, its a solid homework that has helped me understand the Value Iteration, Q-Learning, and many other reinforcement learning concepts and techniques.
