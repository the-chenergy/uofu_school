# Problem 1

## Part (a)

$$
\begin{aligned}
  P(Y \ne 1) &= P(Y = 0)\\
             &= P(Y = 0 \cap X = 0) + P(Y = 0 \cap X = 1)\\
             &= 0.4 + 0.1\\
             &= \boxed{0.5}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Part (b)

$$P(X = 1 \cap Y = 0) = \boxed{0.1}$$

## Part (c)

$$
\begin{aligned}
  P(X = 1 | Y = 0) &= P(X = 1 \cap Y = 0) \div P(Y = 0)\\
                   &= 0.1 \div 0.5\\
                   &= \boxed{0.2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Part (d)

Yes since the probability of X being some value does not depend on the value of Y, which is the definition of independence. For example,
$$P(X = 1) = 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.2 = P(X = 1 | Y = 0) = P(X = 1 | Y = 1)$$

# Problem 2

## Part (a)

For $i \in \{1, 2, \cdots, 8\}$, by linearity of expectation, we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
  E(C_i) &= E[A_i \times E(M_{ji})]\\
         &= E(A_i) \times E(M_{ji})\\
         &= [2P(A_i = 2) + 1P(A_i = 1)] \times [1P(M_{ji} = 1) + 0P(M_ji = 0)]\\
         &= (2 \times 0.5 + 1 \times 0.5) \times (1 \times 0.7)\\
         &= \boxed{1.05}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Part (b)

Since $C_i$ is the same for every $i \in \{1, 2, \cdots, 8\}$, the answer is
$$8 \times E(C_i) = 8 \times 1.05 = \boxed{8.4}$$

## Part (c)

For $i \in \{9, 10, 11, 12\}$, by linearity of expectation, we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
  E(C_i) &= E[A_i \times E(M_{ji})]\\
         &= E(A_i) \times E(M_{ji})\\
         &= [2P(A_i = 2) + 1P(A_i = 1)] \times [1P(M_{ji} = 1) + 0P(M_ji = 0)]\\
         &= (2 \times 0.5 + 1 \times 0.5) \times (1 \times 0.6)\\
         &= \boxed{0.9}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Part (d)

Since $C_i$ is the same for every $i \in \{9, 10, 11, 12\}$, the answer is
$$4 \times E(C_i) = 4 \times 0.9 = \boxed{3.6}$$

## Part (e)

$$C_1 + C_2 + ... + C_{12} = 8.4 + 3.6 = \boxed{12}$$

## Part (f)

By linearity of expectation,
$$
\begin{aligned}
  E(\text{Points}) &= E(3 \times \text{Field goals made})\\
                   &= 3 \times E(\text{Field goals made})\\
                   &= 3 \times 12\\
                   &= \boxed{36}
\end{aligned}
  $$
