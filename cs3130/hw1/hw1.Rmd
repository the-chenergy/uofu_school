# Problem 1

### Part (a)

No, it is not possible to have $P(B) = 0.7$, given that $A$ and $B$ disjoint events and that $P(A) = 0.4$.

According to the second rule in the definition of a probability function, when $A$ and $B$ are disjoint events, we have

$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$

Therefore, in this scenario when $P(A) = 0.4$ and $P(B) = 0.7$, since $A$ and $B$ disjoint,
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.4 + 0.7 = 1.1$$

However, the definition also states that a probability function must assign every event in a sample space $\Omega$ a number within $[0, 1]$. Since the event $A \cup B$ has a probabilty of 1.1 > 1, it is not a valid event. Therefore, when $P(A) = 0.4$, it is not possible to have $P(B) = 0.7$.

### Part (b)

According to the definition of the difference between sets, we have

$$A \cap B^c = A - B$$

However, $A$ and $B$ are disjoint events ($A \cap B = \emptyset$), all elements in $A$ are not in $B$, meaning that

$$A - B = A - (A \cap B) = A - \emptyset = A$$

Therefore,

$$A \cap B^c = A$$

# Problem 2

### Part (a)

$$\Omega^3 = \{H, T\}^3 = \{(H, H, H), (H, H, T), (H, T, H), (H, T, T), (T, H, H), (T, H, T), (T, T, H), (T, T, T)\}$$

### Part (b)

1. $\{(H, T, T), (T, H, T), (T, T, H)\}$

2. $\{(H, T, T), (T, H, T), (T, T, H), (T, T, T)\}$

3. $\{(H, H, H), (H, H, T), (H, T, T), (T, T, T)\}$

# Problem 4

### Part (a)

\begin{align*}
P(R^c) &= 1 - P(R) \text{  [The 1}^\text{st}\text{ probability rule]} \\
       &= 1 - 0.1 \\
       &= 0.9
\end{align*}

### Part (b)

\begin{align*}
P(R \cup F) &= P(R) + P(F) - P(R \cap F) \text{  [The 2}^\text{nd}\text{ probability rule]} \\
            &= 0.1 + 0.07 - 0.03 \\
            &= 0.14
\end{align*}

### Part (c)

\begin{align*}
P(R^c \cup F^c) &= P(R \cap F) \text{  [De Morgan's Law]} \\
                &= 0.03
\end{align*}

# Problem 5

### Part (a)

After we have chosen a bag, since we pick a ball at random from the bag, the probabily of picking a blue ball is:

* $\frac{2}{2} = 1$, if we have chosen a bag with only blue balls;

* $\frac{1}{2}$, if we have chosen a bag with mixed blue and red balls; or

* $\frac{0}{2} = 0$, if we have chosen a bag with only red balls.

Let:

* $E$ be the event that we choose a blue ball at the end,

* $B$ be the event that we choose a bag containing only blue balls in the beginning,

* $M$ be the event that we choose a bag containing mixed blue and red balls in the beginning, and

* $R$ be the event that we choose a bag containing only red balls in the beginning.

Since we first choose a one bag at random, and bags are independent from each other, we have

\begin{align*}
P(E) &= P(B) \times P(E | B) + P(M) \times P(E | M) + P(R) \times P(E | R) \\
     &= P(B) \times 1 + P(M) \times \frac{1}{2} + P(R) \times 0 \\
     &= \frac{7}{16} \times 1 + \frac{5}{16} \times \frac{1}{2} + \frac{4}{16} \times 0 \\
     &= \frac{19}{32}
\end{align*}

There is a $\frac{19}{32}$ (about 59%) chance that we have picked a blue ball at the end.

### Part (b)

Let $O$ be the event that the other ball is also blue. Since $O$ can only happen (and must happen) when we have chosen a bag containing only blue balls in the beginning, we have

\begin{align*}
P(O | E) &= \frac{P(O \cap E)}{P(E)} \\
         &= \frac{P(B)}{P(E)} \\
         &= \frac{7}{16} \div \frac{19}{32} \\
         &= \frac{14}{19}
\end{align*}

There is a $\frac{14}{19}$ (about 74%) chance that the other ball in the bag is also blue.
