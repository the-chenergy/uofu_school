Problem 1
The following table shows two different processors with identical clock frequencies
(clock rates) and very different relative performance scores. In fact, one processor has nearly
twice the performance over the other.
Processor Name

Frequency

Relative Performance

Intel Core i9-9900K (Faster)

3.60GHz

2,898

Intel Core i5-680 (Slower)

3.60GHz

1,550

What is causing this dramatic difference between the performance? According to the
equations of performance and execution time, frequency is not the only factor. Assuming that the
numbers of instructions are the same for both processors when running the testing program, the
CPI (cycles per instruction) makes all the difference.

E xecution time =

Instructions [I] × Cycles per instruction [CP I]
F requency

P erf ormance =

1
Execution time

Therefore,

P erf ormance =

F requency
I × CP I

According to the table, assuming that the base processor (which the processors’ performance
scores are relative to) has a performance of 1s-1, for each processor,

2, 898s−1 =

3.6×109 Hz
I × CP I F aster

1, 550s−1 =

3.6×109 Hz
I × CP I Slower

Therefore, assuming the numbers of instructions are the same for both processors,
CP I F aster
CP I Slower

=

3.6×109 Hz ÷ (2,898s−1 × I)
9

3.6×10 Hz ÷ (1,550s−1 × I)

=

1,550s−1
2,898s−1

≈ 0.535

Meaning that the faster processor (Intel Core i9-9900K) has a CPI that is about 53.5% of the
CPI that the slower processor (Intel Core i5-680) has.

Problem 2
The following table provides two processors of the same family that have different
frequencies.
Processor Name

Frequency

Relative Performance

Intel Core i9-9900K (Faster)

3.60GHz

2,898

Intel Core i9-7960X (Slower)

2.80GHz

2,337

What is the difference between their CPIs? From the previous problem:

P erf ormance =

F requency
I × CP I

Therefore, for each of the processors (with the assumption that the base processor has a
performance score of 1s-1),

2, 898s−1 =

3.6×109 Hz
I × CP I F aster

2, 337s−1 =

2.8×109 Hz
I × CP I Slower

And assuming that they have the same number of instructions,
CP I F aster
CP I Slower

=

3.6×109 Hz ÷ (2,898s−1 × I)
9

2.8×10 Hz ÷ (2,337s−1 × I)

=

3.6×109 Hz × 2,337s−1
9

2.8×10 Hz × 2,898s−1

≈ 1.04

Meaning that the faster processor (Intel Core i9-9900K) has a CPI that is about 104% of the
CPI that the slower processor (Intel Core i5-680) has. It may sound surprising that the slower
processor has a lower CPI, but it makes sense if we take the ratios into account. The frequency of
the faster processor is about 129% (3.6GHz / 2.8GHz) of the slower processor, but the faster
processor’s performance score is only 124% (2,898 / 2,337) of the slower. The slower processor
performs relatively better than expected, therefore, its CPI must make up for it and be less than
the faster processor’s CPI (assuming the same number of instructions, of course).

Problem 3
According to the equation of yield,

Y ield ≈

1
[1 + (Def ects per area ×

Die area 2
)]
2

The number of defects per area is not the only factor of yield. A smaller die area can
compensate for the increase in defects per area and even increase the yield.

Problem 4
● The program responds with 469,193 to my student number 1,172,983.
● The program responds to 2,932,458 with my student number 1,172,983.
● The program always responds to the input with int(input / 2.5) (if the input is positive, or
0 if it is negative).
