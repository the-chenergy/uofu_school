Submit your SinglyLinkedList.java, LinkedListStack.java, and BalancedSymbolChecker.java files
and the java files for your tester class(es). All files should be in the assign06 package.

Only one student in a programming pair should submit the program files. See Assignment 2 for
instructions on how to designate a group in Gradescope./*

The auto-grader is set to run a minimal set of "pre-tests" to ensure you have included all
required classes and methods specified above. Note that passing the "pre-tests" is worth 10 /
70 points for the Assignment 6 program. The remaining points will be assessed after the
assignment deadline and based on whether your code passes "post-tests", as well as how good
your style / design and testing is. Note that Assignment 6 is 70 points for programming and
30 points for analysis.
