    "<!--\n",
    "The original NFA accepted strings with the second-to-last character being a \"1\", meaning that the stack of its equivalent PDA only ever needs to store 2 characters, the last two characters in the string. When this NFA was now reversed, it accepts strings with the second (-to-first) character being a \"1\", and its PDA stack would have to hold all characters after the second character, since PDA has the left-most character on the top of its stack.\n",

    "* Prompt: RE\n",
    "  - ANSWER: `''+0+1+(0+1)*1(0+1)`\n",
    "* Prompt: Largest STKMAX below 9\n",
    "  - ANSWER: 8 was the largest stack size that failed.\n",
    "* Prompt: Type of linearity compared to that in ```pda_if_sndlast_then_1```\n",
    "  - ANSWER: The reversed CFG was left-linear while the original CFG was right-linear.\n",
